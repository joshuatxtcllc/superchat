    "content": "Developing a strategy to get your custom framing business featured on local news, especially when focusing on AI and automation, involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Identify Your Unique Selling Proposition (USP):** Highlight how AI and automation are transforming your business. What makes your approach innovative compared to others?\n\n2. **Create a Compelling Story:** Journalists are interested in stories that have a human element. Focus on how these changes are impacting your employees, customers, or even the local economy.\n\n3. **Develop Relationships with Local Media:** Reach out to local journalists and media outlets. Follow them on social media, comment on their stories, and engage with them to build a rapport before pitching your story.\n\n4. **Prepare a Press Release:** Draft a clear and concise press release that outlines your story, the benefits of your new approach, and why it is newsworthy. Include quotes from key stakeholders in your business.\n\n5. **Leverage Social Media and Online Platforms:** Use your business's social media accounts to share your story and tag local media outlets. This can catch the attention of journalists looking for interesting local stories.\n\n6. **Host an Event or Demonstration:** Invite local media to a demonstration of how AI and automation are used in your framing business. This could include a tour of your facilities or a live demonstration of the technology in action.\n\n7. **Offer Expert Commentary:** Position yourself or someone in your business as an expert in the field of AI and automation in the framing industry. Offer to provide commentary or insights on related news stories.\n\n8. **Follow Up:** After your initial contact, follow up with journalists to see if they need more information or are interested in developing your story further.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, you can increase the likelihood of your business being featured in the local news. \n\n```mcp-json\n{\n  \"protocol\": \"mcp\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"model_assessment\": {\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"reasoning\": \"The response provides a comprehensive strategy for media engagement tailored to the business's innovative use of AI and automation.\",\n      \"better_suited_models\": []\n    },\n    \"conversation_state\": {\n      \"topics\": [\"media strategy\", \"AI and automation\", \"business innovation\"],\n      \"pending_questions\": [],\n      \"key_entities\": [\"custom framing business\", \"local news\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",

    "content": "To make your story a \"home run\" and a no-brainer for the media, consider these additional steps:\n\n1. **Highlight Community Impact:** Emphasize how your business's transformation benefits the local community. This could be through job creation, supporting local artists, or environmental sustainability.\n\n2. **Share Success Stories:** Provide case studies or testimonials from customers who have benefited from your services since implementing AI and automation. Real-life success stories are compelling and relatable.\n\n3. **Create a Visual Story:** Media outlets love visual content. Provide high-quality photos and videos that showcase your technology in action, your team at work, and before-and-after transformations in your products.\n\n4. **Partner with Local Influencers:** Collaborate with local influencers or industry experts who can vouch for your innovations. Their endorsement can lend credibility and attract media attention.\n\n5. **Offer an Exclusive:** Give a local media outlet the first opportunity to cover your story. Exclusivity can be a powerful incentive for them to pick up the story.\n\n6. **Tie into Current Trends:** Connect your story to broader trends in technology, sustainability, or industry-specific developments. Demonstrating relevance to current events can make your story more newsworthy.\n\n7. **Engage with Community Events:** Participate in local events or host your own that align with your story. Media are more likely to cover events that have a community angle.\n\n8. **Provide Data and Metrics:** Offer concrete data and metrics that show the impact of AI and automation on your business performance, such as increased efficiency, reduced costs, or enhanced customer satisfaction.\n\nBy focusing on these elements, you can craft a story that is not only appealing but also irresistible for media outlets to cover.\n\n```mcp-json\n{\n  \"protocol\": \"mcp\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"model_assessment\": {\n      \"confidence\": 0.95,\n      \"reasoning\": \"The response provides targeted strategies to enhance media appeal, leveraging community impact, visuals, and data-driven success.\",\n      \"better_suited_models\": []\n    },\n    \"conversation_state\": {\n      \"topics\": [\"media strategy\", \"AI and automation\", \"business innovation\", \"community impact\"],\n      \"pending_questions\": [],\n      \"key_entities\": [\"custom framing business\", \"local news\", \"community\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```",
