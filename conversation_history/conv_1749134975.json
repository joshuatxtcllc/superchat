This includes learning front-end and back-end technologies, databases, and relevant frameworks.\n   - **Advanced Skills**: Developing expertise in building enterprise-level applications may require an additional 1-2 years, depending on the complexity of the technologies involved and the individual's learning pace.\n\n2. **Development Phase**:\n   - **Application Complexity**: The time to develop each application can vary widely. A simple application might take a few weeks, while a complex enterprise-level application could take several months.\n   - **Team vs. Individual**: Working as part of a team can significantly speed up the process, as tasks can be distributed among team members.\n\n3. **Iteration and Improvement**: \n   - Real-world applications often require iterative development, testing, and refinement, which adds to the time.\n\nAssuming an average development time of 2-4 months per application for one person, developing 100 applications could take several years.
