INPUT LAYER\n- Human issues natural language prompt\n- Text/voice interface captures input\n- Input is tokenized and normalized\n- Context is established\n\n2. UNDERSTANDING LAYER\n- Natural Language Processing (NLP) parses meaning\n- Intent classification identifies desired action\n- Entity extraction identifies key components\n- Parameter extraction finds specific values\n\n3. VALIDATION LAYER\n- Permission checking\n- Safety validation\n- Resource availability\n- Feasibility assessment\n\n4. TRANSLATION LAYER\n- Convert natural language to machine instructions\n- API call formatting\n- Command sequence generation\n- Parameter mapping\n\n```mcp-json\n{\n  \"protocol\": \"mcp\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0\",\n  \"context\": {\n    \"model_assessment\": {\n      \"confidence\": 0.9,\n      \"reasoning\": \"Clear understanding of action execution chain and requirements\",\n      \"better_suited_models\": []\n    },\n    \"conversation_state\": {\n      \"topics\": [\"action execution\", \"system architecture\", \"automation flow\"],\n      \"key_entities\": [\"input processing\", \"execution chain\", \"system components\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n5. EXECUTION LAYER\nRequired Components:\n- API endpoints\n- Authentication tokens\n- Access permissions\n- Execution environment\n- Runtime context\n\nExample Chain:\n\"Send an email to John\" \u2192\n1. NLP identifies:\n   - Action: send\n   - Object: email\n   - Recipient: John\n\n2. System needs:\n   - Email service API\n   - John's email address\n   - Authentication credentials\n   - Message content\n   - Permission to send\n\n3. Execution requires:\n   - API client\n   - Network access\n   - Error handling\n   - Success confirmation\n\nCritical Elements:\n\n1. INFRASTRUCTURE:\n- Servers\n- Networks\n- APIs\n- Databases\n- Security systems\n\n2. INTEGRATION POINTS:\n- API gateways\n- Authentication services\n- Data connectors\n- Service buses\n\n3. CONTROL SYSTEMS:\n- Monitoring\n- Logging\n- Error handling\n- Rollback capabilities\n\n4. SECURITY:\n- Authentication\n- Authorization\n- Encryption\n- Audit trails\n\nReal World Example:\n\"Turn on the kitchen light\" \u2192\n\n1. Voice/text input captured\n2. NLP processes intent (action: activate, target: kitchen light)\n3. Smart home system validated\n4. Command translated to API call\n5. Home automation hub receives instruction\n6. Physical relay activated\n7. Light turns on\n8. Confirmation returned\n\nRequired Components:\n- Voice/text interface\n- NLP engine\n- Smart home hub\n- Network connectivity\n- Device control API\n- Physical hardware\n- Feedback system\n\nThis chain demonstrates why AI language models alone can't execute actions - they're missing the physical integration layers and execution components needed to affect real-world change.",
